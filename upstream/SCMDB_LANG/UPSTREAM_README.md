# SCMDB Community Translations

Community-maintained translations for [SCMDB](https://scmdb.dev) — the Star Citizen Mission & Data Browser.

SCMDB displays all data in English by default. This repo provides the tools for community translation teams to create their own language files that users can load in the browser.

## For Translation Teams

### What you need

1. **Python 3.10+** (no external dependencies)
2. **`build_lang_template.py`** (this repo)
3. **`lang-template-*.json`** (this repo, updated each patch by SCMDB)
4. **Your community `global.ini`** (the Star Citizen translation file your team maintains)

### How to build a translation

```bash
# PTU (default)
python build_lang_template.py --translate path/to/your_global.ini

# LIVE (when a live template is available)
python build_lang_template.py -p live --translate path/to/your_global.ini
```

The `-p` flag selects which template to use when multiple are present (e.g. `lang-template-*-ptu.*.json` vs `lang-template-*-live.*.json`). Default is `ptu`.

This produces a `lang-your_global-4.7.0-ptu.11494258.json` file with a coverage report:

```
=== Result ===
  File:          lang-your_global-4.7.0-ptu.11494258.json
  Total:         3340
  Translated:    3250
  Missing:       3
  Mismatch:      26 (token placeholders in foreign text)
  No loc key:    80 (kept as-is)
  UI sidecar:    12 (scmdb_ui_* from community sidecar)
```

Missing keys automatically fall back to English text.

#### Token substitution

The tool automatically resolves token placeholders in translated text. For example, if a mission title contains `[RANK]`, the tool looks up the translated rank name (e.g. "Master" -> "Мастер") in your `global.ini` and inserts it. This reduces manual post-processing significantly.

#### Output filename

The output filename is derived from your `global.ini` filename. To control the language code in the output, name your INI file accordingly:

```bash
# Input: global_ru.ini -> Output: lang-global_ru-4.7.0-ptu.11494258.json
# Input: german_global.ini -> Output: lang-german_global-4.7.0-ptu.11494258.json
```

### Translating SCMDB's own UI strings

Almost everything you translate comes from CIG's `global.ini`. One set of
strings does not: SCMDB's own interface text — mission badges, Fabricator
panel labels, tooltips. These live in the template under the `scmdb_ui_*`
namespace, and no `global.ini` will ever contain them, because they are not
game data.

> **Availability:** the `scmdb_ui_*` keys ride in the LIVE template as of
> `4.10.0-live.12545750`. The PTU template picks them up with its next rebuild.
> Until then use `-p live`, otherwise the sidecar has nothing to match against.

To translate them, place a **sidecar file** next to your `global.ini`:

```
translations/
  global_zh-CN.ini
  scmdb_ui_zh-CN.json     <- picked up automatically
```

No extra flag needed — the build finds it by name:

```bash
python build_lang_template.py --translate translations/global_zh-CN.ini
```

```
  UI sidecar: scmdb_ui_zh-CN.json (12 entries)
```

**Naming.** `scmdb_ui_<lang>.<ext>`, where `<lang>` matches your INI. For
`global_zh-CN.ini`, both `scmdb_ui_zh-CN.json` and `scmdb_ui_global_zh-CN.json`
are recognised; for `chinese_global.ini` it is `scmdb_ui_chinese.json`. A
sidecar whose name does not match is never picked up silently — the build
prints a hint instead. To use a file with a different name or location, point
at it explicitly:

```bash
python build_lang_template.py --translate global_zh-CN.ini --translate-ui my_ui_strings.json
```

#### Sidecar format

JSON is preferred — it round-trips placeholder tokens and special characters
without surprises. A flat key -> translation map is all it takes:

```json
{
  "scmdb_ui_tag_legal": "合法",
  "scmdb_ui_tag_new_tt": "新增于补丁 {patch}",
  "scmdb_ui_tag_wip": "开发中"
}
```

A `keys` wrapper is accepted as well, so you can keep metadata next to the
strings, and a value may be given as `{"en": ..., "tr": ...}` — the `tr` side
is used:

```json
{
  "lang": "zh-CN",
  "keys": {
    "scmdb_ui_tag_legal": "合法"
  }
}
```

An `.ini` sidecar (same `key=value` format as `global.ini`) works too:

```ini
scmdb_ui_tag_legal=合法
scmdb_ui_tag_new_tt=新增于补丁 {patch}
```

Two rules:

- **`scmdb_ui_*` keys only.** Anything else in the file is ignored with a
  warning. Game data belongs in your `global.ini`, not here — a sidecar
  answering CIG keys would report flawless coverage while shipping English.
- **UTF-8.** Both formats — which covers every script, Chinese and Japanese
  included. What is *not* accepted is a legacy codepage: what Windows editors
  call "ANSI" is cp1252 in Western Europe, GBK in China, Shift-JIS in Japan.
  Such a file is rejected with an error rather than read, because decoding it
  as anything else corrupts the text silently. In VS Code the setting is
  *Save with Encoding → UTF-8*; in Notepad it is the *Encoding* dropdown of
  the Save-As dialog.

Include only the keys you have translated. Anything you leave out — or leave
empty — keeps its English text. The full list of available keys is in the
template: every entry under `keys` whose name starts with `scmdb_ui_`.

#### Placeholders

Some of these strings carry placeholder tokens in curly braces: `{patch}`,
`{n}`, `{count}`, `{chance}`, `{material}`, `{pool}`, `{systems}`. SCMDB
substitutes them with the real value when the page renders.

Keep the token spelled exactly as it is. You are free to move it anywhere in
the sentence:

| Key | English | zh-CN |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `scmdb_ui_tag_new_tt` | `Added in patch {patch}` | `新增于补丁 {patch}` |
| `scmdb_ui_tag_waves_tt` | `{n} waves` | `{n} 波` |

Renaming or dropping a token breaks the substitution — the string then renders
with a literal `{patch}` in it.

#### In the report

Sidecar entries count as **Translated**, and get their own summary line:

```
  UI sidecar:    12 (scmdb_ui_* from community sidecar)
```

`scmdb_ui_*` keys you have not translated do **not** show up under *Missing* —
they were never in `global.ini` to begin with. They are listed separately:

```
=== SCMDB UI strings without translation (47) ===
  scmdb_ui_fab_preset_base
  ...
```

Entries in your sidecar that had no effect are called out too, so a typo does
not cost you an afternoon:

```
=== UI sidecar entries that did not apply (2) ===
  Not present in this template (2):
    scmdb_ui_tag_ilegal
    scmdb_ui_tag_retired_key
  -> typo in the key, a retired key, or a template that
     predates the string. Nothing was written for these.
```

If CIG ever ships a key with the same name, CIG's `global.ini` wins — the
sidecar is only consulted where the INI has no answer, and the shadowed
sidecar entry is listed under *Answered by your global.ini instead*.

### How to publish your translation

1. Host the generated `lang-*.json` file somewhere publicly accessible:
   - **GitHub** (recommended): Push to your own repo, use the Raw URL
   - **Any web server** with CORS enabled (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
   - **GitHub Gist**: Upload and use the Raw URL

2. Share the direct URL with your community:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-team/scmdb-translations/main/lang-de-4.7.0-ptu.11494258.json
   ```

3. When a new patch drops:
   - Pull the updated `lang-template-*.json` and `build_lang_template.py` from this repo
   - Re-run `python build_lang_template.py --translate path/to/your_global.ini`
   - Update your hosted file

### File format

The output JSON contains English + translated text for each key:

```json
{
  "version": "4.7.0-ptu.11494258",
  "sourceLanguage": "en",
  "targetLanguage": "global_ru",
  "keyCount": 3340,
  "keys": {
    "Adagio_BasicSalvage_Title_01": {
      "en": "Claim #[CLAIM]: [SHIP] Salvage Rights",
      "tr": "ПРАВО НА УТИЛИЗАЦИЮ #[CLAIM]: [SHIP]"
    },
    "items_commodities_gold_ore": {
      "en": "Gold (Ore)",
      "tr": "Золото (Руда)"
    }
  }
}
```

## What is translated?

Translations cover **in-game data only** — mission titles, descriptions, location names, ship names, item names, faction names, and other strings sourced from Star Citizen's `global.ini`.

A defined subset of SCMDB's **own** interface text is translatable as well — mission badges, Fabricator panel labels and their tooltips — via the `scmdb_ui_*` sidecar described above. These are opt-in: without a sidecar they stay English, and nothing breaks.

The remaining website chrome (navigation, buttons, column headers, filters, settings) stays English by design — localizing it would require layout adjustments, pluralization rules, and formatting changes that go far beyond simple string replacement.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a Star Citizen account?**
A: No. You just need Python and a `global.ini` file (your translation team provides this).

**Q: Why are some keys missing from my translation?**
A: CIG adds new mission texts each patch. If your `global.ini` doesn't have them yet, English is used as fallback.

**Q: What are "Mismatch" entries?**
A: CIG sometimes has different English text in foreign language `global.ini` files compared to the English version. These mismatches are reported but the translated text is still included.

**Q: What are "Substituted" entries?**
A: Mission tokens like `[RANK]` or `[CARGO_GRADE]` are automatically replaced with the translated value from your `global.ini`. For example, `[RANK]` becomes "Мастер" in Russian.

**Q: The report lists `scmdb_ui_*` keys as untranslated. Where do I get them from?**
A: Not from `global.ini` — those are SCMDB's own interface strings. Put a `scmdb_ui_<lang>.json` sidecar next to your INI, see "Translating SCMDB's own UI strings" above.

**Q: Can I manually edit the output JSON?**
A: Yes. You can fix or improve any translation directly in the JSON file after generation.

**Q: How often does the template update?**
A: With every Star Citizen patch that changes mission data. Check this repo for new `lang-template-*.json` files.
